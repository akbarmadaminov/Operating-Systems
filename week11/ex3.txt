As in line buffering data in buffer will be written on output only when newline character is inserted 
or in case when the buffer is full and stdout is line-buffered here, so:

In the Program 1, before creating a child process buffer is not empty, that's why data will be printed in both processes
In the Program 2, data is written on output and buffer is empty before fork() call, so there is only one printed 'Hello' in parent
