16-bit virtual address => we have 2^16 possible addresses. 
Pages are 8KB => 2^13 for the entire page

Then, whole adress space can be divided into number at least needed for the pages:
(2^16)/(2^13) = 8 => So 8 entries (equals to number of pages) are needed for a single-level linear page table.
